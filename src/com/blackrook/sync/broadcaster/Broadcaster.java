/**
 * Broadcaster class for all sorts of message broadcasting to attached receivers.
 * <p>
 * All Broadcasters are thread-safe and wait for all broadcasts to complete before
 * adds and removes can happen, due to the {@link ReentrantReadWriteLock} that this uses.
 * The broadcast happens in the same thread that calls {@link #broadcast(Object)}, and does not offload
 * the message object in a separate thread. Best combined with a {@link WorkPool} for broadcasting
 * lots of messages asynchronously, with each spawned job doing the broadcast.
 * @param <M> the message type to broadcast to attached listeners.
